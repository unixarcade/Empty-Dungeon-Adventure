{"name":"Empty-dungeon-adventure","tagline":"","body":"Empty-Dungeon-Adventure\r\n=======================\r\nhttp://luminosity.livejournal.com/964337.html\r\n\r\nThis is probably the least of code you can use to create a text adventure, that you can scale out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/unixarcade/Empty-Dungeon-Adventure\r\n\r\n\r\nThings it does not include\r\n\r\na game loop, \r\nlots of variables to control a character,\r\nstory,\r\nand many other things you could want\r\n\r\n\r\nThe good news is that it is empty enough which is a  good starting point when you want a point to start. This project is for fun it is for people who either know little or nothing you could use the statements follow them out and make the game and world more rich. It can also be used by experienced developers to rip out a text adventure quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince projects that are too full just as games with rules that are not very open in the way they will be used will make for a game that does not allow you the branching of your choice and the impression of your persona upon the game and how you would play it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat and emptiness well it allows us to be the sacred vessel.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
