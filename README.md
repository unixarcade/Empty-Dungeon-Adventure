This is probably the least of code you can use to create a text adventure, that you can scale out.

Things it does not include

a game loop
lots of variables to control a character
story
and many other things you could want


The good news is that it is mostly empty which is a fairly good starting point when you want a point to start so either if you know little or nothing you could use the statements follow them out and make the game and world more rich.

Since projects that are too full just as games with rules that are not very open in the way they will be used will make for a game that does not allow you the branching of your choice and the impression of your persona upon the game and how you would play it.



That and emptiness well it allows us to be the sacred vessel.
